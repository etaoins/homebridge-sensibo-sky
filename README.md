# Usage Notes

- This module modified from the original Sensibo and adopted for Sensibo Sky to improve the stability due
  to the constant ERRCONNECT from Sensibo server when there is too many request.
- The refresh is now splitted to the individual pods instead of all at one go to mininize error from the sensibo server.
- Had also resolved bugs on the fan and better error handling when Sensibo server does not respond.
- A fan speed of 0 means "auto". Otherwise it makes a logical progression from low, medium, medium_high to high.

- Most code adopted from pdlove. Credits goes to original author pdlove
